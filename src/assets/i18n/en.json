  "HOMEPAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Since 2018, Ecuadorians have suffered from economic instability and a crisis of violence, going from being the safest country in Latin America to the most dangerous. Our leaders have repeatedly failed to address these issues. But you have the opportunity to change this. The Citizen Revolution understands these struggles because we have also faced and overcome them. In 2025, we have a new opportunity to build an Ecuador free of violence, with jobs and security. Together, we can create a stronger and more resilient country.",
